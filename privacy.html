        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          Last Updated: June 19, 2022 <br /><br />

          LOUGOU SDN.BHD. and its affiliates (“ LOUGOU”, “we”, “our” and/or
          “us”) are committed to protecting your privacy. In this Privacy Policy
          (“Privacy Policy”), “Personal Information” means any information
          relating to an identified or identifiable individual and “Services”
          mean our websites (“Sites”), including https://lougou.github.io/ and
          other services that link to this Privacy Policy. <br /><br />
          This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, process, and share
          Personal Information in the context of our Services. This Privacy
          Policy does not cover the practices of companies we don’t own or
          control, or people we don’t manage. By using the Services, you
          acknowledge you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
          <br /><br />

          1. Personal Information we collect about you We collect and process
          Personal Information about you or your devices from various sources
          described below. <br /><br />

          2. Personal Information you provide to us This is Personal Information
          about you that you provide directly to LOUGOU, including: • Region and
          language. When you visit our Sites or Apps, we may ask you to select
          your region and language to provide you with the relevant Services. •
          Registration and profile information. If you sign up for an account on
          our Services, we will ask you to provide your name and email address,
          to choose a password, and to select one or more areas of interest
          (e.g., sneakers, streetwear, watches etc.). • Buying / Selling
          information. In order to allow you to purchase or sell a product via
          our Services, we may additionally ask you to provide your postal and
          billing address, phone number, and VAT ID (in order to apply VAT
          discounts). In some jurisdictions, we may also collect your social
          security number or national ID where we are required by law to collect
          such information in order to provide you with the Services. We will
          not collect or store the credit or debit card or other payment
          information that you may provide in the context of the Services.
          Payments made on the Services using a credit or debit card are made
          through a third party payment gateway provider. You will be providing
          credit or debit card information directly to that payment gateway
          provider which operates a secure server to process payment details,
          encrypting your credit or debit card information and authorizing
          payment. Personal Information that you supply to third parties is not
          within our control and is subject to those third parties’ privacy
          policies and terms of service. • Newsletter. If you sign up to receive
          emails or information about our Services, then we will collect
          Personal Information from you, such as your first and last name, email
          address, and your areas of interest. When we send you emails, we may
          track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better customer
          experience and improve our Services. • Communications. When you
          contact us via a contact form, email, phone, or other means (e.g., to
          submit a query, to enter a competition, promotion or survey, or to
          report a problem with our Services), you may provide us with Personal
          Information, such as your name and contact details, language, and the
          content, date, and time of our communications. • Careers. If you apply
          for a job with us directly, you may provide us with your resume, name
          and contact details, and any other information that you submit to us.
          If you apply for a job with us through a third-party platform (such as
          LinkedIn), we will collect the information you make available to us
          through such a third-party platform. In some cases, provision of your
          Personal Information may be necessary to provide you with our
          Services. In these cases, if you fail to provide certain Personal
          Information when requested, we may not be able to give you access to
          our Services. In other cases, for example when we request your
          Personal Information so that we can send you marketing and promotional
          communications, if you do not provide Personal Information we will not
          send you the marketing and promotional communications. We will specify
          the consequences of refusal to provide Personal Information at the
          time of the collection. <br /><br />

          3. Information we collect about you from your use of our Services When
          you use our Services or open our emails, we may collect certain
          information via automated means such as cookies, beacons, invisible
          tags, and similar technologies (collectively “Cookies”). These
          typically involve pieces of information or code that a website
          transfers to or accesses from your computer hard drive or mobile
          device to store and sometimes track information about you.
