        <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
        <p>
          Last Updated: June 18, 2022 <br /><br />

          These are the terms and conditions of use for
          https://lougou.github.io/ ("Site"). The Site is operated by LOUGOU
          SDN.BHD. of Malaysia (“LOUGOU,” “we,” “us”, or “our”) and is a virtual
          store that allows users to research, display, and promote certain
          consumer goods. These Terms and Conditions of Use, our Marketplace
          FAQs (the “FAQS”), and all other requirements posted on our websites,
          all of which are incorporated into these Terms and Conditions of Use
          by reference and as amended from time to time (collectively, “Terms”)
          describe the terms and conditions on which we provide our websites
          (the “Sites”), services, data, software, applications (including
          mobile applications) and tools (collectively “Services”) to you,
          whether as a guest or a registered user. In these Terms, “you” and
          “your” refer to (a) you, the individual accessing and/or using the
          Services, (b) any electronic agent accessing the Sites and/or using
          the Services on behalf of an individual or business entity, and (c)
          the business entity on whose behalf an individual or electronic agent
          is accessing the Sites and/or using the Services. Your use of the
          Sites and Services will be subject to these Terms and by using them
          you agree to be bound by them. These Terms create a legal contract
          between you and us. Please read them carefully. <br /><br />
          We will collect and process personal data in accordance with our
          Privacy Policy https://lougou.github.io/privacy. By using our Sites
          and Services, or by clicking to accept these Terms, you accept and
          agree to be bound and abide by these Terms in full. If you do not
          agree to these Terms, do not use our Sites or any portion of the
          Services. For all purposes, the English version of the Terms shall be
          the original, binding instrument and understanding of the parties. In
          the event of any conflict between the English version of the Terms and
          any translation into any other language, the English version shall
          prevail and control. These Terms contain provisions that govern how
          claims between you and us are resolved (see Section 14, Disputes with
          LOUGOU below). This includes an obligation to arbitrate certain claims
          through binding and final arbitration, unless you opt out of the
          arbitration when you sign up with us. Unless you opt out, you will
          only be permitted to bring claims against us and seek relief on an
          individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or
          representative action or proceeding, and you will only be permitted to
          seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief)
          on an individual basis. As set out in the Country-Specific Terms, this
          clause regarding arbitration will not apply to certain countries.
          <br /><br />

          1. Changes to Terms and Policies. LOUGOU may in our discretion change
          these Terms (including the FAQs or any policy) at any time, but if we
          do, we will place a notice on our Site. We may also send you an email
          and/or notify you by some other means. Changes take effect on the date
          set out in the Terms. You should view these Terms often to stay
          informed of any changes that may affect you. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE
          SITE AND/OR SERVICES AFTER WE CHANGE THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES YOUR
          ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY OF THE CHANGES,
          YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT AND NOT USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICES.
          The version of these Terms posted on our Sites on each respective date
          you visit the Sites will be the Terms applicable to your access and
          use of the Services on that date. Our electronically or otherwise
          properly stored copies of these Terms and the Privacy Policy shall be
          deemed to be the true, complete, valid, and authentic copies of the
          version of the Terms and the Privacy Policy that were in force on each
          respective date you visited the Sites. We reserve the right to
          terminate these Terms, or to refuse, restrict, or discontinue access
          to or use of the Services (or any portions, components, or features
          thereof) to you or any other person or entity, if you are in breach of
          the Terms or for any reason or for no reason whatsoever, at any time,
          without notice or liability. <br /><br />

          2. About LOUGOU Virtual Store. The Site and Services are intended for
          use only by persons who are at least 18 years of age. By using the
          Site and Services you confirm that you meet this requirement and that,
          if you are under the age of 18, you have received permission from your
          parent or guardian before using the Site and Services. LOUGOU allows
          third party sellers to list and sell their products in a live
          marketplace on the Site and Services. Sellers' products will be made
          available for sale on all of our Sites and mobile applications. Buyers
          and sellers must create an account to purchase or sell items on the
          LOUGOU platform (see Section 3). Buyers and sellers can delete or
          deactivate their account by following the options available on our FAQ
          page, as updated from time to time. In these scenarios the contract is
          concluded between buyer and seller under the condition that the
          article’s authenticity is approved by LOUGOU. A further description of
          the live marketplace process and the rules applicable to buyers and
          sellers is available on our FAQ page, as updated from time to time.
          While LOUGOU as the platform provider helps facilitate transactions
          that are carried out on the LOUGOU platform, LOUGOU is neither the
          buyer nor the seller of the seller's products. LOUGOU provides a venue
          for sellers and buyers to negotiate and complete transactions.
          Accordingly, the contract formed at the completion of a sale for these
          third party products is solely between the buyer and seller. Although
          LOUGOU might provide historical pricing data to the buyer and seller,
          we do not set prices for the items and LOUGOU is not an auctioneer.
          LOUGOU acts as a commercial agent to conclude the sale on behalf of
          each buyer and seller involved in each transaction. Because sellers
          set prices, they may be higher than retail value of the products sold
          on our Site. Any item valuations displayed through the Services are
          estimates only. LOUGOU does not guarantee that any item will sell.
          LOUGOU reserves the right to investigate complaints and violations of
          these Terms and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, may take
          any actions we deem appropriate, including suspending a buyer or
          seller account and charging your payment method for costs we incur as
          a result of the violation. Although the Services are anonymous and we
          generally do not share your information with other buyers and sellers,
          we may share your information with law enforcement and professional
          advisers under an obligation of confidentiality as part of an
          investigation related to any alleged violation of law or these Terms
          in accordance with our Privacy Policy, and we may respond to all
          inquiries initiated by law enforcement or other governmental agencies.
          The Services are accessible to certain international sellers and
          buyers. LOUGOU may provide access to certain features and tools to
          international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency
          conversion and integrated international shipping, customs and tax
          tools. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws
          and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and
          shipment of items. <br /><br />

          3. Authentication; Shipping and Handling. As part of the purchase
          transaction, the seller will ship the item to LOUGOU and LOUGOU will
          visually inspect the item and use commercially reasonable efforts to
          confirm it is authentic and meets our condition standards. If LOUGOU
          determines the item is authentic and meets our condition standards,
          LOUGOU will ship the item to the buyer. If LOUGOU cannot reasonably
          confirm the authenticity of the item or determines it is not authentic
          or does not meet our condition standards, then we will notify the
          buyer and the seller that the item has not passed authentication and
          will issue a refund to the buyer. Additionally, LOUGOU has the right
          to reject any item for any reason, including but not limited to,
          authenticity, failure to meet our condition standards, or damage of
          the item. LOUGOU policy requires sellers to ship items within the
          specified timeframe provided in the sale confirmation email after
          purchase. However, because LOUGOU cannot control the amount of time it
          takes for the item to reach LOUGOU, we cannot guarantee a specific
          delivery timeframe for any items and therefore, buyer is not permitted
          to cancel the purchase if the item does not ship from the seller
          within the specified timeframe in the sale confirmation email after
          purchase. Once we receive the item from the seller it generally takes
          1-2 business days for us to authenticate the item and ship it to a
          buyer. If a buyer does not receive an item, the buyer shall promptly
          report the issue to LOUGOU within 2 days of the latest estimated
          delivery date. LOUGOU has the right, in our sole and absolute
          discretion to refuse to accept returns or other refunds and/or to
          charge restocking fees for returned or abandoned items. If a buyer or
          seller refuses to accept delivery of a package sent to his/her address
          on file, LOUGOU will consider the property abandoned after thirty (30)
          days and may charge the buyer or seller LOUGOU’s reasonable expenses
          incurred due to such refusal to accept delivery. <br /><br />

          4. Counterfeits, Fraud, and Market Manipulation. LOUGOU takes
          counterfeiting, fraud and market manipulation very seriously. If a
          seller provides a counterfeit item or attempts to defraud any buyer or
          LOUGOU, LOUGOU reserves the right to do any or all of the following,
          in its sole discretion: (i) remove any or all of seller’s listings
          from the Services; (ii) cancel any or all of seller’s orders pending
          through the Services; (iii) withhold any payments due to seller; (iv)
          place limits on seller’s buying and selling privileges; (v) charge
          seller’s payment method for costs, expenses and fees incurred by
          LOUGOU as a result of seller’s action or inaction, including charging
          seller for the cost of replacement items, the value of coupons and
          gift certificates provided to the buyer, reprinting fees incurred by
          LOUGOU, rerouting charges imposed by carriers, and refunds to the
          buyer; (vi) ship the item back to the seller at the seller’s cost
          (including any customs and duties amounts incurred by LOUGOU); (vii)
          provide the counterfeit items to law enforcement or destroy the
          counterfeit items, (viii) temporarily or permanently suspend seller’s
          account, and (ix) charge seller’s payment method a minimum of RM15.00
          or an amount up to 15% of the transaction amount, in LOUGOU's sole
          discretion, as a service fee. Seller hereby agrees that each of the
          foregoing remedies are reasonable and justified upon LOUGOU’s
          discovery of counterfeit items or fraudulent actions, even if those
          items or actions were not known by the Seller at the time to be
          counterfeit or fraudulent (e.g., negligent fraud). Seller understands
          and agrees that if we provide the counterfeit item to law enforcement,
          seller’s communications and any property claim with respect to that
          item must be solely with that law enforcement agency and not with us.
          We may also use fraud protection measures, including algorithms and
          automated systems to monitor for fraud, which might result in
          cancellation of listings or sales or account suspension. If this
          occurs in error please contact us at https://help.LOUGOU.com. We may
          also require additional identification information from you if you
          engage in certain high-value transactions or high overall payment
          volumes through LOUGOU. If a buyer receives an item that it believes
          to be counterfeit, the buyer must notify LOUGOU in writing within 3
          days after receiving the item, and we will commence an investigation
          into the item. The buyer shall cooperate with us in the investigation
          and final disposition of the item, including providing photographs and
          other evidence of the item, providing the item to law enforcement,
          destroying the item, or delivering the item back to us, at our
          direction. If we elect to have the buyer destroy the item, the buyer
          shall provide reasonable proof of destruction to us. We will refund
          all fees and costs paid by the buyer for the item (including shipping
          and handling). In no event may a buyer resell any item (on LOUGOU or
          elsewhere) that is reasonably believed to be counterfeit. LOUGOU may
          monitor the integrity of the LOUGOU marketplace and may take steps to
          protect the marketplace as determined by LOUGOU in its sole discretion
          (e.g., if LOUGOU believes a seller or buyer is engaging in market
          manipulation or fraud, including creating false or “dummy” accounts).
          If LOUGOU believes that a seller or buyer attempts to interfere with
          the free and fair operation of the LOUGOU marketplace, or creates
          artificial, false or misleading information, or information appearing
          to mislead with respect to pricing or demand for a product on the
          LOUGOU marketplace (all of the foregoing in LOUGOU’s sole discretion),
          then, without limiting any other rights of LOUGOU, LOUGOU reserves the
          right to do any or all of the following, in its sole discretion: (i)
          remove any or all of the user’s listings from the Services; (ii)
          cancel any or all of the user’s orders pending through the Services;
          (iii) withhold any payments due to the user; (iv) place limits on a
          user’s buying and selling privileges; (v) charge user’s credit card
          for costs, expenses and fees incurred by LOUGOU as a result of the
          user’s actions; (vi) notify law enforcement of the fraudulent
          activity; (vii) temporarily or permanently suspend the user’s account,
          and (viii) charge the user’s credit card an additional service fee of
          up to RM1,000 to cover LOUGOU’s investigation fees and other related
          costs and expenses. <br /><br />
